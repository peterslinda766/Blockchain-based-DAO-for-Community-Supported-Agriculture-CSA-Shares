# 🌾 Blockchain-based DAO for Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) Shares

Welcome to a decentralized solution for community-supported agriculture! This Web3 project empowers farmers and communities to manage CSA programs transparently on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It solves real-world problems like lack of trust in fund allocation, opaque decision-making, and inefficient share distribution by leveraging blockchain for immutable records, decentralized governance, and automated payouts.

In traditional CSA, members prepay for farm shares but often face issues with accountability, disputes over produce allocation, and limited input on farm operations. This DAO enables token-based shares, community voting on proposals (e.g., crop choices or sustainability initiatives), and automated distribution of yields or refunds based on harvest outcomes.

## ✨ Features

🌱 Tokenized CSA shares for easy buying, selling, and transferring  
🗳️ Decentralized voting on farm decisions via DAO proposals  
💰 Transparent treasury management for membership fees and payouts  
📊 Immutable tracking of harvest yields and share redemptions  
🔒 Secure membership registration and farmer verification  
⚖️ Automated dispute resolution through smart contract logic  
📈 Yield reporting integration (via oracles for real-world data)  
🚀 Scalable for multiple farms with modular contracts  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to handle different aspects of the CSA DAO. Contracts are designed to be composable, with clear interfaces for interactions. Here's a high-level overview:

### Core Contracts (Written in Clarity)

1. **CSA-Token Contract**: A SIP-10 compliant fungible token representing CSA shares. Handles minting shares for new members, burning upon redemption, and transfers between users.
   - Key functions: `mint-shares`, `transfer`, `get-balance`.

2. **Membership Contract**: Manages user registrations as DAO members. Verifies eligibility (e.g., via STX payments) and tracks active memberships.
   - Key functions: `register-member`, `renew-membership`, `get-member-info`.

3. **Treasury Contract**: Holds and disburses funds (STX or tokens) from membership fees. Automates payouts to farmers based on predefined rules.
   - Key functions: `deposit-fees`, `withdraw-for-farm`, `get-treasury-balance`.

4. **Governance Contract**: Core DAO logic for proposing and voting on changes (e.g., crop selection or budget allocation). Uses token-weighted voting.
   - Key functions: `submit-proposal`, `vote-on-proposal`, `execute-proposal`.

5. **Proposal Storage Contract**: Stores proposal details separately for efficiency, including descriptions, voting periods, and outcomes.
   - Key functions: `store-proposal`, `get-proposal-details`, `update-status`.

6. **Yield Oracle Contract**: Integrates external data feeds (via trusted oracles) for reporting real harvest yields, triggering automated distributions.
   - Key functions: `submit-yield-report`, `verify-report`, `get-yield-data`.

7. **Redemption Contract**: Allows members to redeem shares for produce or equivalent value. Handles claims and prevents double-spending.
   - Key functions: `redeem-shares`, `claim-produce`, `get-redemption-status`.

8. **Farmer Admin Contract**: Enables farmers to set up and manage their CSA DAO instance, including initial share issuance and admin controls.
   - Key functions: `initialize-dao`, `update-farm-details`, `verify-farmer`.

### For Farmers (DAO Creators)

- Deploy the contracts and initialize the DAO via the `Farmer Admin Contract`.
- Set share prices and total supply in the `CSA-Token Contract`.
- Submit harvest updates through the `Yield Oracle Contract` to trigger distributions.
- Propose governance changes (e.g., "Switch to organic fertilizers") using the `Governance Contract`.

### For Members (Shareholders)

- Register via the `Membership Contract` by paying STX fees.
- Buy shares from the `CSA-Token Contract`.
- Vote on proposals in the `Governance Contract` based on your token holdings.
- Redeem shares for produce at season's end using the `Redemption Contract`—claims are verified against yield data.

### Verification and Transparency

- Check treasury funds anytime with `get-treasury-balance`.
- Verify proposal outcomes via `get-proposal-details`.
- All transactions are immutable on the Stacks blockchain, ensuring trust without intermediaries.
